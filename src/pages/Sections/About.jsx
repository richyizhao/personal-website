          My journey began in high school, where I explored Design and Visual Communication, learned 
          graphic communication and 3D modeling. In programming, I gained skills in web development. 
          In Robotics, focused on embedded programming and CAD software.

          I was captivated by the process of bringing ideas to life through technology, which inspired me 
          to pursue <span className="emphasis">Computer Science</span> at <span className="emphasis">University of Auckland</span> to help me expertise and explore IT.

          At UOA, I developed skills in software development and AI. Where I was taught how to build 
          complex web applications using functional programming. I also focused on database design. 
          Covered machine learning techniques, and addressed software security.         
        </p>

          As I look to the future, I aim to explore cutting-edge technologies and their applications. I am 
          particularly interested in fields such as AI and cloud infrastructure.
